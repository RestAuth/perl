This library is still somewhat in the early stages of development.

1. No homepage exists yet.
2. Only some functions are implemented yet.
3. No API documentation exists yet.
4. No further documentation exists yet.

== current implementation status ==
Currently all user management functions and property management functions
are implemented and tested. Group functions are NOT implemented. 

This library should behave almost identical to the RestAuth client
implementations in Python[1], PHP[2] or Java[3].
